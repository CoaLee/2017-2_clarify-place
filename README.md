# 2017-2 CID2: Clarify Place

suggested by Naver corp.

Goal: guess the intention of users who search places.

 i. DB work + data processing on previous history of queries.(my part)
 ii. Using neural network to guess.

Originally worked with 2 other members in a private gitlab repository(gitlab.com/clarify\_place/clarify\_place). In this public repo has been imported some part of the project worked by myself. 

Description of my work is in 'Final Report/yong\_part.txt'.
